# FAIRTIQ: Training ML models in the cloud with AWS Sagemaker

Welcome to our code repository that accompanies our [blog post](https://fairtiq.com/en/tech/training-ml-models-in-the-cloud-with-aws-sagemaker) on scaling Machine Learning (ML) models for startups. As your startup grows and the ML datasets become larger, training models on your laptop becomes impractical. This repository provides a solution to this challenge by utilizing cloud-based platforms for ML training.

__Challenges addressed:__

1. Slow training as the dataset grows and inability to close the laptop during training.
2. The need for a shared view on model performance as the ML team expands.

__Cloud-based platforms:__

To tackle these challenges, we recommend using cloud-based platforms like AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, or Google AI Platform. These platforms are actively developed and offer a wide range of features and configurations to suit various use cases.

__Documentation concerns:__

However, navigating these platforms can be daunting due to the rapidly growing number of features, outdated documentation, and fragmented information. Many tutorials also focus on toy examples (such as CIFAR data) that may not be relevant to real-life systems.

__Our Code:__

In this repository, you'll find the code that complements our blog post, providing you with a practical approach to scaling ML models using cloud-based platforms. We aim to simplify the process and guide you through the essential steps to set up and train your models efficiently.

Happy Scaling!
